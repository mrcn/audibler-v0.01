# How Ideological Frames Work: The Próspera Case Study
## Understanding Genuine Belief, Measurement, and the Constitutive Nature of Ideology

---

## How to Read This Document

### Document Structure

This essay explores how ideological frameworks function not as cynical cover stories, but as genuine perception-organizing structures that determine:
- What counts as evidence
- What questions get asked
- What problems become visible
- What acts you understand yourself to be performing

Using the case of Próspera (a private charter city in Honduras) as a concrete example, we examine how intelligent, well-intentioned people can genuinely believe they're doing good while doing something that, from another analytical frame, looks like buying sovereignty from a criminal enterprise.

## Part 1: The Facts of the Case

### What Próspera Is

Próspera is a private "charter city" on Roatán island, Honduras, operated by a Delaware-incorporated company. It functions with extraordinary autonomy:

- **Legal Independence**: Operates outside Honduran law with its own courts, regulations, and tax system
- **Tax Structure**: 1% business tax, 5% income tax (compared to Honduras's standard rates)
- **Regulatory Innovation**: Bitcoin as legal tender; residents can pick regulations from a menu of 36 countries or propose their own
- **Governance**: Honduras Próspera Inc. has veto power over the governing council

### Who's Behind It

- **Founder**: Erick Brimen, Venezuelan-American wealth manager
- **Backers**: Peter Thiel, Marc Andreessen, Sam Altman, Balaji Srinivasan, Coinbase Ventures
- **Funding**: Pronomos Capital raised approximately $150 million
- **Investment**: Próspera claims to have invested around $200 million, representing almost a third of all greenfield foreign direct investment into Honduras in 2022

## Part 2: Why Critics Call It a "Narco Project"

The legal framework that made Próspera possible was created by people now convicted of drug trafficking. Understanding this timeline is crucial:

### The Timeline

**2009**: US-backed military coup ousts left-wing president Manuel Zelaya

**2012**: Honduran Supreme Court rules charter cities unconstitutional

**2012**: Congress (led by Juan Orlando Hernández) fires the four justices who ruled against charter cities

**2013**: New ZEDE (Zones for Employment and Economic Development) law passes, amending the constitution to allow private cities

**2014-2022**: Juan Orlando Hernández serves as president, champions ZEDEs

**2017**: Próspera founded under the ZEDE framework

**2022**: Hernández extradited to the United States

**2024**: Hernández convicted of trafficking **400+ tons of cocaine** into the US, using the Honduran military and police to protect drug shipments. Sentenced to 45 years.

**December 2025**: Trump pardons Hernández (notably, Thiel and Andreessen are close Trump allies)

### The Direct Connection

The man who:
- Fired the judges blocking charter cities
- Championed the ZEDE law as Congress president
- Protected ZEDEs as president of Honduras

...was simultaneously running a cocaine trafficking operation moving hundreds of tons of drugs through Honduras using state resources.

President Xiomara Castro called Próspera a creation of a "narco-regime" because the entire legal architecture enabling it was built by a convicted drug kingpin.

---

## Part 3: The $11 Billion Dispute

### The Legal Conflict

**2022**: Castro government repeals ZEDE law; Supreme Court declares it unconstitutional

**2022**: Próspera sues Honduras for $10.775 billion under CAFTA-DR investment protection provisions

### The Scale

- **Two-thirds** of Honduras's annual budget
- **One-third** of GDP
- Honduras withdrew from ICSID (World Bank arbitration) but must still defend the case
- Case is ongoing — Honduras lost preliminary objections in February 2025

---

## Part 4: Local Community Impact

### What Villagers Report

The nearby village of Crawfish Rock presents a different narrative than Próspera's promotional materials:

**Consultation Issues**:
- Community says they were never properly consulted
- Told it was a "tourism project"
- Didn't learn it was a ZEDE until 2020

**Community Leader Testimony**:
Luisa Connor: "They deceived us big time."
Connor: "The city will grow like a tumor. We will be the first to lose what we have."

**Reported Impacts**:
- Próspera threatened to cut off the village's water supply unless leaders submitted a written request
- Floods for the first time in memory
- Dried-up river
- Environmental damage
- Family divisions
- Constant stress

**Current Situation**:
While some locals (like Virginia Mann) work for Próspera and report positive experiences, there is documented community resistance that was significant enough to make ZEDE opposition a signature campaign issue for President Castro.

---

## Part 5: Próspera's Side of the Story

### On the Legal Framework and "Narco" Origins

Próspera's fundamental argument: **the law is the law**.

They point out that:
- The ZEDE legislation passed with roughly 80% of Congress supporting it
- Constitutional reforms were unanimously approved by the Supreme Court (after reconstitution)
- They signed binding legal agreements with the Honduran government in 2017, including a 50-year legal stability guarantee
- CAFTA-DR (the US-Central America trade agreement) protects their investment regardless of who was in power when the laws passed

**CEO Erick Brimen's framing**: Próspera is a victim of Honduras's political instability, not a beneficiary of corruption.

"Most recently, the biggest challenge came in September of last year when the Supreme Court of Honduras ruled the ZEDE law unconstitutional. I recognize that transformative ideas often face obstacles before gaining broader acceptance."

### On the $11 Billion Claim

Próspera frames this as defensive, not aggressive:
- They "did everything reasonably possible to avoid filing the claims, but the Government of Honduras continues to refuse to cooperate with our sustained efforts to find a negotiated solution"
- The full amount only applies if Honduras completely expropriates their investment—it's a ceiling, not a demand
- Honduras "could mitigate the substantial liability it faces under international law by providing clear assurances that Honduras has no intention of expropriating investments in Próspera"

### On Local Community Relations

Próspera vigorously disputes the critical narrative:

"We work closely with the local people, are the primary employer, and have a great connection with them. Only two people in the neighborhood are against us; the media only focuses on them."

They promote stories like Virginia Mann from Crawfish Rock: "Próspera has not only provided employment but has also created a supportive and caring work culture where employees feel valued and heard."

On displacement: "Can Jeff name 1 resident we have displaced? Of course not; the statement is false & misleading." Their charter explicitly disallows land expropriation—land can only join Próspera if owners voluntarily opt in.

### On the Mission

Brimen, a Venezuelan who grew up seeing "the poverty caused by socialism and lack of rule of law," frames the project as poverty relief through better governance:

"Honduras Próspera is a comprehensive solution to a systemic problem, that addresses the issues at the root and lifts people out of poverty and into prosperity in a sustainable way."

**The pitch**: Combine Honduras's people and location with best-practice governance from around the world. The "reciprocity stacking" model allows combining regulations from multiple OECD countries—so you can get a UK-approved drug, with a US-licensed doctor, using an Israeli medical device, following a Canadian procedure, all in one place.

### On Sovereignty

"We're not here at the expense of a nation-state. We think it is more of a partnership." Brimen notes that 88% of Próspera's tax revenue stays with Próspera, with the remainder going to a trust for broader Honduran development.

---

## Part 6: The Obvious Tensions

Even taking Próspera's framing charitably, certain facts remain:

1. **The judicial coup happened**: The judges who blocked charter cities were fired. The Inter-American Court of Human Rights subsequently condemned Honduras for this.

2. **Hernández is convicted**: The man who championed ZEDEs from Congress president through two presidential terms was running cocaine operations the entire time. Próspera can claim the law was valid, but they can't make the taint disappear.

3. **Local opposition is real**: Even if not universal, there's documented community resistance, and the nationwide movement against ZEDEs was significant enough to make it a signature campaign issue for Castro.

4. **The power asymmetry is grotesque**: An $10.8 billion claim against a country where half the population lives in poverty, representing two-thirds of the annual budget, is aggressive regardless of legal merit.

### Even Paul Romer Objects

Paul Romer—the Nobel laureate who *invented* the charter city concept—says Próspera is "living in this libertarian fantasy that's not going to turn out well."

Romer's original charter city concept involved guarantor nations—a developed democracy would oversee governance, providing legitimacy and accountability. The ZEDE model dropped this requirement. The result is a charter city without the thing that was supposed to make it legitimate.

---

## Part 7: The Central Question

### How Do They "Not Notice"?

Here's where the analysis becomes interesting. The easy critique is: "They know what they're doing and use ideology as cover."

But this misses what's actually happening. If Brimen were consciously thinking "I'm exploiting a weak country and using freedom rhetoric as a shield," he'd be a different kind of person—more cynical, probably less effective, and the project would have a different feel.

**The harder question**: How do you *genuinely believe* you're doing good while doing something that, from another angle, looks like buying sovereignty from a criminal enterprise?

---

## Part 8: The Measurement Insight

### Frames Determine What You Track

When you adopt a framework, you're selecting:
- What counts as evidence
- What counts as success
- What questions to ask
- What comparisons to make

"Freedom" as an organizing principle makes certain things visible (regulatory burden, tax rates, barriers to entry) and other things invisible or recategorized (power asymmetries, selection effects, who gets to make choices and who doesn't).

### What Brimen Sees

Looking at Próspera through the freedom/governance frame, Brimen genuinely sees:
- Businesses forming ✓
- Regulations streamlined ✓
- Jobs created ✓
- Innovation enabled (gene therapy! prediction markets!) ✓
- Voluntary transactions everywhere ✓

All true! All *real*. Within the frame, it's working.

### What the Frame Doesn't Measure

These aren't hidden exactly—they're just *not what you're tracking*. They're like peripheral vision. You could look at them, but nothing in your dashboard tells you to:

- Why was Honduras available when US states weren't?
- What made the government willing to sign 50-year binding agreements?
- Whose choices created the conditions, and whose choices are constrained by them?
- What happens to populations who didn't choose but are affected?

---

## Part 9: The "Genuine Belief" Mechanism

### How It Works

The mechanism appears to operate like this:

**1. You have a theory**

Good governance produces prosperity. Regulatory competition is healthy. Exit rights discipline bad states.

This theory is not crazy—there's real intellectual content, historical examples, coherent arguments.

**2. The theory provides your optimization target**

You're now trying to maximize "good governance zones" or "regulatory freedom" or "voluntary association."

**3. Selection effects operate on your perception**

The Virginia Manns (satisfied local employees) are *evidence that you're succeeding*.

The Luisa Connors (frightened community leaders) are *noise*, or *misinformation*, or *people who don't understand yet*, or *the two people the media always talks to*.

**4. The theory also provides your threat model**

Opposition comes from: entrenched interests, corrupt governments, socialists, people who don't want the poor to have options.

So when Castro's government opposes you, it *fits the template*. You don't need to ask "are they representing legitimate democratic will?" because you already know what opposition means.

**5. Revealed preferences diverge from stated ones—but you're measuring stated**

You say you want poverty reduction. You're measuring business formation and regulatory freedom. If those diverge from poverty reduction, you might not notice, because that's not what your dashboard shows.

---

## Part 10: The Deepest Version

### Ideology as Constitutive, Not Just Filtering

What if the ideology doesn't just filter perception but actually *constitutes what you're doing* for you?

Brimen isn't "buying sovereignty from a narco-state and using ideology as cover." He's "bringing good governance to an underserved population."

**These are the same physical actions but different acts.**

The ideology isn't packaging around the act—it's partly *constitutive* of what act you understand yourself to be performing.

This is why you can know all the facts and still genuinely believe. The facts don't determine the act-description. A frame does. And once you're inside a frame, the facts *organize* themselves around it.

---

## Part 11: The "Seeing Like a State" Parallel

### High Modernist Planners

James Scott's analysis of high modernist planning provides a useful parallel:

The planners weren't lying when they said they wanted to improve agriculture and rationalize cities. They genuinely did. The ideology gave them a way of *seeing* that made certain things (grid patterns, standardized crops, legible populations) register as improvements and other things (local knowledge, organic adaptation, illegibility as a resource) disappear or register as problems to be solved.

**They could stand in front of a destroyed peasant community and genuinely see progress.**

Not because they were evil, but because "progress" had been operationalized in a way that made the destruction either invisible or necessary.

---

## Part 12: What Makes Próspera Interesting

### A Sophisticated Frame with Structural Blindspots

The libertarian/charter-city frame is *sophisticated about some things*:
- It sees government failure!
- It sees regulatory capture!
- It understands that incumbents extract rents!
- It's not naive high modernism

But it has its own blindspots that are structural, not incidental:

| What It Sees Clearly | What It Has Trouble Seeing |
|---------------------|---------------------------|
| State coercion | Market/capital coercion |
| Regulatory barriers | Power asymmetries in "voluntary" transactions |
| Gains from exit | Who has exit options and who doesn't |
| Its own acts as chosen | Others' constraints as natural |

---

## Part 13: How They "Don't Notice"

Not by suppressing information. By having a frame that genuinely organizes information into a shape where what they're doing looks like what they think they're doing.

**The darkest implication**: You cannot fix this by providing more information. The frame metabolizes information. You'd have to change the frame—but the frame is also their identity, their community, their sense of what they're good at and what gives their work meaning.

This is why ideological conflict is so persistent. It's not that one side has facts and the other has delusions. It's that both sides have *organizing structures* that make different facts salient and give them different meanings.

---

## Part 14: Frames as Question-Generators

### What Frames Actually Do

A frame isn't a metric like "5% tax rate." You can't look at a spreadsheet and see a "freedom score."

Instead, a frame is more like a **question-generator combined with a sorting mechanism for what matters**.

### The Libertarian Frame Generates Questions Like:

- Is this transaction voluntary?
- Can you exit if you don't like it?
- Is someone using force or fraud?
- What are the barriers to entry?

When you're asking these questions, certain things become answerable and relevant:
- Tax rates answer: "how much of your stuff does the state take?"
- Regulatory burden answers: "what permissions do you need to act?"
- Barriers to entry answer: "can you compete?"

These aren't "freedom" exactly—they're things that become visible when you're asking freedom-questions.

### What Doesn't Become Visible

Not because it's hidden, but because the questions don't ask about it:

**"Is this transaction voluntary?"** doesn't ask "what conditions led to this being the best option available?"

A Honduran worker "voluntarily" taking a job at Próspera isn't being coerced by Próspera—but the question doesn't probe why this is their best option, what alternatives existed, who structured the choice set.

**"Can you exit?"** doesn't ask "what's the cost of exit relative to your resources?"

Próspera can exit Honduras (relocate capital, sue for damages). Honduras can't exit CAFTA-DR without massive cost. The formal freedom is symmetric; the actual capacity is wildly asymmetric. But "can you exit?" returns yes/yes.

---

## Part 15: The Counter-Frame

### A Domination Frame

What frame makes power asymmetries visible but recategorizes things like tax rates?

Try a **domination frame**—something like Phillip Pettit's republican liberty or a class-analysis lens. The core question is: **who has power over whom, and under what conditions?**

### This Generates Different Questions:

- Who set the terms of this arrangement?
- Who can change the terms unilaterally?
- Who can impose costs on whom?
- What are the relative exit costs?
- If there's a dispute, whose forum decides?
- Whose choices are constrained by whose prior choices?

### Looking at Próspera Through the Domination Frame:

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| Who set the terms? | Próspera negotiated with Hernández government; Crawfish Rock not at the table |
| Who can change terms unilaterally? | Próspera has 50-year stability guarantee; Honduras can't change without triggering arbitration |
| Who can impose costs? | Próspera can sue for $11B; Honduras can... try to regulate and get sued |
| Relative exit costs? | Próspera can relocate capital; Honduras is the territory |
| Whose forum decides disputes? | ICSID (World Bank), not Honduran courts |

In this frame, **the power asymmetry is the main thing you see**. It's what the questions surface.

---

## Part 16: What Happens to Tax Rates?

### Recategorization, Not Disappearance

Tax rates don't disappear from the domination frame—but they get recategorized.

**Instead of**:
"1% business tax = more freedom"

**You get**:
"1% business tax = capital successfully exempting itself from contributing to public goods in a country where it extracts value"

The tax rate becomes **evidence of power** rather than **measure of freedom**. It's a symptom, not a metric. You wouldn't optimize for lower taxes; you'd ask "who had the power to set taxes this low, and what does that tell us about the structure?"

---

## Part 17: A Concrete Example

### Two Scenarios

**Scenario A**: A Honduran worker chooses to work at Próspera for $15/hour instead of $8/hour elsewhere.

**Scenario B**: A Honduran subsistence community finds that the land around them is now a ZEDE with different rules, their water supply is controlled by a private entity, and their choices are: adapt to the new system, move, or resist and face whatever consequences.

### How Each Frame Sees Them

**The freedom frame sees scenario A clearly**:
- Voluntary transaction ✓
- Better wages ✓
- Revealed preference for Próspera ✓
- Looks good!

**The freedom frame has a harder time with scenario B**:
- No one is technically forcing anyone
- Every step was "voluntary" by someone
- But the community's choice set was radically restructured by other people's prior choices, and they weren't party to those choices

**The domination frame sees B clearly**:
- The community is subject to power they didn't consent to and can't easily escape

**The domination frame sees A differently too**:
- Why is $8/hour the alternative?
- What structures produce that?

---

## Part 18: Neither Frame is "Wrong"

### They're Asking Different Questions

Each frame will generate different prescriptions for what to do about Próspera, because each frame identifies different problems.

**Freedom frame problem**:
Is anyone initiating force or fraud? If not, what's the issue?

**Domination frame problem**:
How did this power relation emerge, who benefits, who's subject to whom, is that legitimate?

---

## Part 19: Why This Matters for "Genuine Belief"

### Living Inside a Frame

Brimen lives in the freedom frame. The questions he asks are freedom-questions. The answers he gets tell him he's doing well.

He's not suppressing the domination-frame questions—**they're just not his questions**. They don't feel like the relevant questions to him, because his whole intellectual formation has been in a tradition where freedom-questions are the questions.

This is what "not noticing" means:
- Not willful ignorance
- Not cynical cover
- **Differential question-generation**

The frame isn't just filtering his perception of pre-existing facts. It's constituting what counts as a fact worth noticing in the first place.

---

## Part 20: The Systemic Read (Channeling Michael Vassar)

### Everyone is Lying About What They Want

The progressive critique wants you to see: corrupt drug president → ZEDE law → Próspera. Evil flows downstream.

But zoom out: Hernández was a US ally. He received military aid, DEA cooperation, State Department praise. The Obama and Trump administrations both worked with him while the drug evidence was accumulating. The same US government that eventually prosecuted him spent years enabling him.

**So when Próspera says "we operated within the legal framework," they're not wrong**—but that framework was jointly produced by the Honduran narco-state AND the US national security apparatus. The legitimacy question doesn't stop at the Honduran border.

### What Próspera Actually Is

**The libertarian story**: We're bringing good governance to a country that lacks it, Hong Kong on the Caribbean, innovation zones, regulatory arbitrage for human flourishing.

**The progressive story**: Neocolonial extraction, sovereignty violation, billionaire playground.

**The systemic read**: Both frames are copes that prevent seeing the actual object.

**What's really happening**: A group of people with a lot of capital wanted to buy the right to run a territory with minimal democratic accountability. They found a seller. The seller was a criminal enterprise, but that's *why it was for sale*—functional states don't sell sovereignty. The ideological packaging (freedom! innovation! charter cities!) is partially genuine belief, partially marketing, and partially a way for the participants to not notice what they're doing.

### The Selection Effect is the Tell

Brimen tried US states first. Rejected.

The model requires finding jurisdictions where:
- Governance is weak or captured
- Elites are willing to sell binding long-term commitments
- The population can't effectively resist
- International arbitration can override domestic politics

This isn't an accident or unfortunate necessity. **It's the core product.** Próspera isn't a charter city that happened to end up in a narco-state. The narco-state condition is what made the product possible.

### On the Tech Billionaire Involvement

Thiel, Andreessen, Altman, Srinivasan. What do these people actually want when freed from political constraints?

The revealed preference here is: a place where they can do experimental gene therapies, avoid FDA oversight, implement prediction markets, run unregulated crypto operations, and build luxury compounds—all insulated from democratic accountability by international treaty.

The "poverty relief" framing is not exactly a lie—some locals do get jobs—but it's not what's being optimized for. **What's being optimized for is exit**: the ability to operate outside the jurisdiction of any government that might constrain you.

Balaji Srinivasan's "Network State" thesis is the explicit version: why capture existing states when you can build new ones? Próspera is the pilot project.

### The ISDS Lawsuit Reveals the Real Model

The $11 billion claim isn't an unfortunate necessity. **It's the product working as designed.**

The entire architecture—50-year legal stability agreements, CAFTA-DR arbitration clauses, Delaware incorporation—exists precisely to create this situation: a democratic government tries to exit an arrangement made by a corrupt predecessor, and the cost is set high enough to be prohibitive.

**This is how capital disciplines states.** Próspera is just being unusually visible about it. The same mechanism operates constantly through less dramatic investment treaties.

### What's Actually Happening

A class of people with enough capital to buy small countries is experimenting with doing so. The ideological frame (liberty, innovation, escape from sclerotic regulation) is real enough to them, but the function is creating zones of exception where wealth can operate without democratic override.

Honduras is the test case because it was weak enough to sell. The question isn't whether Próspera is good or bad—it's whether this model scales, and what the world looks like if it does.

### The Darkest Read

The Trump pardon of Hernández, the Thiel/Andreessen Trump connections, the Próspera lawsuit—these aren't separate events. There's a faction that wants to normalize this model: private sovereignty zones, backed by US power, insulated from democratic accountability, protected by trade agreement arbitration.

**Próspera isn't an anomaly. It's a proof of concept.**

---

## Part 21: The Meta-Level - What Frame Analysis Itself Misses

### What We're Actually Doing

In analyzing Próspera through competing frames, we're combining three analytical traditions:

**1. Goffman's Frame Analysis** (Micro-Sociological)

We're examining how people "organize experience" and what "primary frameworks" they use to interpret situations. The core question: [how is observed rather than what is observed](https://medium.com/higher-neurons/the-three-orders-of-observation-2ec412add997).

**2. Second-Order Observation** (Luhmann's Systems Theory)

We're not just observing Próspera—we're [observing how Brimen and his critics observe Próspera](https://luhmann.ir/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Deconstruction-as-Second-Order-Observing.pdf). This is the move from "what do they see?" to "how do they see?"

According to Luhmann, observation is "a dual operation of drawing a distinction and indicating one of the distinct parts as the currently relevant one." We're examining *which distinctions each frame draws*.

**3. Epistemic Ideology Critique**

We're analyzing how [power relations condition epistemic frames](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14409417.2022.2081410) and how "legitimation stories" become epistemically suspect when they're "self-justifying" products of power structures.

---

### The Blindspots of Frame Analysis

Here's what our approach **systematically misses**, according to critics:

#### 1. Macro Power Structures and Political Economy

[Goffman's approach "cast intentional framing as a move away from a more 'authentic' reality rather than as an element that revealed the struggles for power constituting or maintaining that reality"](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/symb.1201).

**What this means for our Próspera analysis:**

We're analyzing *how* Brimen sees vs. *how* Castro sees. But we're not asking:
- Why does the libertarian frame have institutional support (think tanks, venture capital, elite networks)?
- Why does it get to be operationalized (actual sovereignty zones) while other frames don't?
- What material conditions make certain frames viable and others not?

The freedom frame isn't just an idea Brimen has—it's backed by $150 million, connections to Trump, and CAFTA-DR treaty infrastructure. **The frame exists in a material ecology of power.**

#### 2. Class and Economic Structures

[Goffman himself acknowledged](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/symb.1201) he didn't extend "his analysis further, so as to include class differences in 'the structure of experience individuals have at any moment of their lives.'"

**For Próspera:**

We're not asking: Why do people with billions get to *choose* their frames and operationalize them, while Honduran villagers have frames *imposed on them*?

The asymmetry isn't just epistemic—it's economic. Brimen can shop for jurisdictions. Luisa Connor can't shop for countries.

#### 3. Material Reality and Constraints

Frame analysis can make everything seem like interpretation, missing that some things are *materially true* regardless of frame:

- Honduras lost 1/3 of GDP in 1998 to Hurricane Mitch
- Hernández trafficked 400 tons of cocaine (documented, convicted)
- The $11B lawsuit is real debt/threat regardless of how anyone frames it

[Critics argue](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00413803) constructivism about frames "culminates in nihilistic relativism" and that "the constructivist account in terms of negotiation and social consensus is less plausible than the alternative realist story."

#### 4. Why Certain Frames Win

Our analysis shows how *different frames see differently*. But it doesn't explain:
- Why the freedom frame is ascendant in Silicon Valley
- Why it has purchase with US foreign policy
- Why it can mobilize capital while other frames can't

This is where [epistemic ideology critique](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/social-philosophy-and-policy/article/critical-responsiveness-how-epistemic-ideology-critique-can-make-normative-legitimacy-empirical-empirical-again/0F3B4C3D411E097E7D9E0A249C5ED274) points out: "beliefs supporting a hierarchical power structure should not be a product of that same power structure."

The freedom frame gets institutional support *because it serves power*. Our analysis notices the frame but not its political economy.

---

### The Relativism Trap

Here's the deepest problem: If we say "everyone's just operating from different frames, and frames determine what counts as evidence," then **how do we adjudicate between them?**

Does frame analysis mean:
- Brimen and Castro are just using different frames, neither more valid?
- We can't say Próspera is actually exploitative vs. liberating—just that different frames see it differently?
- There's no ground to stand on for critique?

[Paul Boghossian argues](https://ndpr.nd.edu/reviews/fear-of-knowledge-against-relativism-and-constructivism/) this "makes it impossible for us to be moved to belief by our epistemic reasons"—if everything is frame-dependent, we lose the ability to have rational disagreement.

---

### What We're NOT Seeing By Using Frame Analysis

By treating Próspera as a "case study of frames," we're potentially missing:

1. **Moral Reality**: Maybe buying sovereignty from a drug trafficker is actually wrong, not just "looks wrong in the domination frame"

2. **Material Causation**: The political economy that makes charter cities possible (neoliberal trade agreements, debt crises, US hegemony)

3. **Historical Specificity**: Why this model emerges *now* (post-2008, tech wealth concentration, state fragility)

4. **Actual Suffering**: Luisa Connor's stress and fear aren't just "visible in the domination frame"—they're real

5. **Power**: Who has the power to impose their frame on reality vs. who has reality imposed on them

---

### What Our Frame-Analysis-Frame Does Well

Despite these limitations, frame analysis is useful for:

- Understanding *how intelligent people maintain contradictory beliefs*
- Explaining why "more information" doesn't resolve ideological conflicts
- Showing how perception is structured, not just biased
- Revealing the constitutive (not just filtering) nature of ideology

But it's:
- **Interpretive** not **explanatory** (shows *how* they see, not *why* this frame dominates)
- **Relativizing** not **critical** (risks treating all frames as equally valid perspectives)
- **Cognitive** not **material** (focuses on belief rather than power)
- **Individualistic** not **structural** (Brimen's frame, not the conditions that produce and empower it)

We're doing sophisticated epistemology. But we might be missing the political economy.

---

## Part 22: Strengthening the Analysis - Theoretical Tools and Applications

Having identified the limitations of pure frame analysis, let's examine how other theoretical frameworks have tackled similar problems and what they can teach us about Próspera.

### 1. Goffman's Frame Analysis: The Original Applications

#### How Goffman Used It

[Goffman's Frame Analysis (1974)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/symb.1201) didn't study abstract ideology—it examined concrete social situations. His method: "take a large number of illustrations, variously obtained, and try to get a formulation that is compatible with all of them."

**His examples were deliberately varied**: card games, theater performances, news clippings, gynecological examinations, nudist colonies, children playing "doctor," ballroom dancing, servants in wealthy homes. He drew from novels, memoirs, journalism, ethnography—anywhere he could find situations where the same action meant different things in different contexts.

The key insight: **the same physical activity gets radically different meanings depending on frame**.

For example:

- Strangers holding each other closely and moving rhythmically = "dance" frame (acceptable)
- Same action without the dance frame = sexual harassment

- Nudity in a "clinical" frame = medical examination
- Nudity in an "artistic" frame = photography
- Nudity in a "health" frame = nudist colony
- Nudity in a "play" frame = children playing doctor

#### Applied to Próspera

What would Goffman notice about Próspera? **Multiple framings of the same actions operating simultaneously:**

| Physical Action | Freedom Frame | Domination Frame | Development Frame | Colonial Frame |
|----------------|---------------|------------------|-------------------|----------------|
| Signing 50-year legal stability agreement | Protecting investment, creating certainty | Binding future democracies, constraining sovereignty | Attracting FDI, enabling growth | Extracting concessions during state weakness |
| $11B lawsuit | Enforcing contract rights, seeking compensation | Economic coercion, disciplining states | Protecting rule of law | Punishing decolonization |
| Virginia Mann's employment | Voluntary exchange, better wages | Limited alternatives, structured choices | Job creation, poverty reduction | Labor extraction with local face |
| Regulatory "menu" system | Freedom of choice, innovation | Power to set the menu, frame the options | Best practices, regulatory efficiency | Imposing external standards |

**Goffman's contribution**: Shows that the contestation isn't about *facts* but about **which frame is legitimate for the situation**. The fight between Próspera and Castro isn't "are there jobs?" but "is this a 'voluntary market exchange' situation or a 'sovereignty violation' situation?"

### 2. Luhmann's Second-Order Observation: Observing the Observers

#### The Original Theory

[Luhmann's systems theory](https://medium.com/deterritorialization/social-systems-and-autopoiesis-a34f52fe9da1) asks: not "what is observed?" but "how is observed?" and crucially, **"who is the observer?"**

Key concept: [**Observation is "a dual operation of drawing a distinction and indicating one of the distinct parts as the currently relevant one"**](https://www.leydesdorff.net/kybernetes/observer.pdf)

**Applied examples from contemporary research:**

- **Social Media (Instagram)**: Users don't just present themselves—they curate profiles while constantly observing how others are observing them. You're not posting a photo; you're posting while imagining how your followers will interpret it, which changes what you post. This is second-order observation: observing how others observe you. The content is determined not by "what you want to show" but by "what you think they want to see you showing."

- **Market Pricing**: Stock prices don't reflect what a company is "worth" in some objective sense. They reflect what traders think other traders think it's worth. You're not observing the company—you're observing how other observers are observing it. This is why markets can be "irrational" even when all participants are individually rational: they're stuck in recursive loops of observing observations.

- **Urban Planning Participation**: [Research reanalyzing spatial planning cases](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13563475.2019.1627185) through Luhmann's lens showed that "participation" meant completely different things to planners vs. community members. Planners observed participation through a "process/outcomes" distinction (did we follow the procedure? did we get consensus?). Community members observed through a "power/powerlessness" distinction (do our concerns actually change anything?). Both groups were at the same meetings, but operating in different observation systems that couldn't see each other.

#### Applied to Próspera

**The key distinctions each observer draws:**

| Observer | Primary Distinction | What Gets Indicated | What Gets Hidden |
|----------|-------------------|-------------------|------------------|
| Brimen/Próspera | Voluntary / Coercive | Market exchanges (voluntary) | Power asymmetries in structuring "choice" |
| Castro government | Sovereign / Subordinate | National control vs. foreign impositions | Potential economic benefits |
| Tech investors | Innovative / Stagnant | Próspera's experimental governance | Exploitation dynamics |
| Crawfish Rock villagers | Secure / Threatened | Water access, land tenure, community integrity | Próspera's "jobs created" metric |
| International media | Success / Failure | Either "thriving innovation hub" or "neocolonial exploitation" | The mundane, contradictory everyday reality |

**Luhmann's crucial addition**: Each observer's observation is **autopoietic**—self-reproducing.

Brimen observes Próspera through the voluntary/coercive distinction. This observation produces more observations using the same distinction. When confronted with community opposition, the distinction makes him observe: "are they being forced?" → "no" → therefore it's voluntary → opposition must be misinformation or misunderstanding.

**The system reproduces itself.** New information doesn't change the observation system—it gets processed *through* the system.

This is why "just show them the facts" doesn't work. The facts get observed through the existing distinction-system, which reproduces itself.

### 3. James Ferguson's "Anti-Politics Machine": Development as Depoliticization

#### The Original Case Study

[Ferguson's 1990 study of the Thaba-Tseka Development Project in Lesotho](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Anti-Politics_Machine) is probably the most directly relevant precedent for analyzing Próspera.

**Background**: Lesotho is a small country entirely surrounded by South Africa. From 1975-1984, the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) and the World Bank funded a major "integrated rural development" project in Thaba-Tseka, a mountainous region. The project aimed to transform the economy through livestock improvements, infrastructure, and agricultural modernization.

**What Ferguson Found:**

Development agencies described Lesotho as "isolated," "non-market," and "traditional"—a proper target for aid intervention.

The development reports portrayed Lesotho as if it existed in a bubble, untouched by the modern economy, where subsistence farmers lived much as their ancestors had. The "problem" was lack of development; the "solution" was technical intervention.

**What they ignored**: Lesotho's actual role as a labor reserve for South African mines. Its history as a grain-exporting region. Its entrapment in the regional apartheid economy.

**Why they ignored it**: "Not wanting to deal with the apartheid South African regime, development agencies isolated the 'independent' Lesotho from the regional economy in which it was entrapped."

**The result**: [Projects that failed with "astonishing regularity" but nonetheless produced "regular and unacknowledged effects, including the expansion of bureaucratic state power and the translation of the political realities of poverty and powerlessness into 'technical' problems awaiting solution by 'development' agencies and experts."](https://www.upress.umn.edu/9780816624379/anti-politics-machine/)

Ferguson coined the term [**"anti-politics machine"**: the tendency to strip development activities of their political context, obscuring underlying realities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Anti-Politics_Machine).

#### Applied to Próspera

The parallel is striking. Look at how Próspera's framing obscures political realities:

| Political Reality | How It's Rendered "Technical" | Effect |
|------------------|----------------------------|--------|
| Honduras is weak/captured because of US-backed coups, drug war, neoliberal structural adjustment | "Poor governance" + "lack of rule of law" = technical deficit Próspera can fix | Depoliticizes US role; makes intervention seem benign |
| Hernández was trafficker + US ally simultaneously | Ignored entirely; "legal framework was valid regardless of who passed it" | Treats law as technical instrument separate from power |
| $11B lawsuit is economic coercion | "Contract enforcement" + "rule of law" + "investment protection" | Renders power asymmetry as neutral legal process |
| Community has limited options because of structural poverty | "Voluntary employment" + "revealed preference" | Treats constrained choice as free choice |
| CAFTA-DR binds states to protect capital | "International law" + "treaty obligations" | Naturalizes neoliberal legal architecture |

**Ferguson's key insight for Próspera**: Even if Próspera "fails" to reduce poverty (which we don't know yet), it will produce **unacknowledged effects**:

1. **Expansion of private governance power** - Precedent that corporations can buy sovereignty
2. **Strengthening of international arbitration** - ICSID claims becoming more aggressive
3. **Depoliticization** - Questions about who should govern become "technical" questions about "governance quality"
4. **Reinforcement of neoliberal framework** - Even debating Próspera on its own terms (does it create jobs? reduce poverty?) accepts the frame

The "anti-politics machine" doesn't fail—**it does exactly what it's designed to do: translate political questions into technical ones**.

### 4. Aihwa Ong: Neoliberalism as Exception

#### The Framework

Aihwa Ong is an anthropologist who studied how Asian countries adopted neoliberal economic policies not uniformly, but selectively—creating special zones with different rules. Her key concept is **"graduated sovereignty"**: the state doesn't have uniform power everywhere; it creates zones of exception where different rules apply.

[Ong's concept of "neoliberalism as exception"](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-institutional-economics/article/abs/political-economy-of-special-economic-zones/CE09F95681408037426D2F4D210BEEA5) examines how "Asian governments have selectively adopted neoliberal forms in creating economic zones" through **"zoning technologies"** that carve special spaces to regulate groups in relation to market forces.

**Her original examples**: Chinese Special Economic Zones in the 1980s-90s (Shenzhen, etc.) where capitalist markets operated while the rest of China remained socialist. Malaysia's Multimedia Super Corridor creating tech zones with different labor laws. Singapore's selective citizenship policies creating tiers of rights based on economic value.

Recent scholarship on [Special Economic Zone (SEZ) urbanism](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0016718525002039) conceptualizes it as "a multi-scalar governance mechanism that integrates industrial, financial, and real estate capital within a single exceptional institutional framework."

#### What This Reveals About Próspera

Próspera isn't an anomaly—it's part of a **global pattern of "graduated sovereignty"** where:

- States create zones of exception
- Different rules apply inside vs. outside
- Capital flows to the exception zones
- The exception becomes the model

But Próspera is a more extreme version: it's not a state creating its own SEZ, but a **private entity buying the right to create exception zones**.

**The escalation**:
1. Classic SEZ: State creates zone, attracts capital with tax breaks
2. Charter city (Romer's vision): State invites developed country to administer zone
3. ZEDE/Próspera: Private corporation buys zone-creation rights, governed by corporate entity

Each step further **separates economic governance from democratic accountability**.

Ong's framework reveals: this isn't just about Honduras. It's about whether **private capital can territorialize itself**—claim physical space where it makes the rules.

### 5. Bourdieu: Symbolic Violence and Habitus

#### The Concepts Applied to Development

Pierre Bourdieu was a French sociologist who studied how power operates not just through force or law, but through making hierarchies seem natural and legitimate. His key concepts:

**Habitus**: "deeply ingrained habits, skills, and dispositions that individuals acquire through their life experiences" shaped by social background. It's the set of unconscious dispositions—how you stand, speak, what feels natural, what seems obvious—that you absorb from your social environment. A working-class kid and a upper-class kid in the same room will have different habitus: different comfort levels with authority, different assumptions about what's possible, different "feel for the game."

**Symbolic Violence**: When domination is achieved not through force but by getting the dominated to accept the dominant group's categories and values as natural and legitimate. It's violence because it maintains hierarchy and inequality. It's symbolic because it works through meaning, not coercion. Example: Getting colonized people to view their own culture as "backward" and the colonizer's as "civilized."

[Bourdieu's concept of symbolic violence](https://scholarworks.wmich.edu/jssw/vol44/iss4/6/) provides "a missing link between subjective experiences and invisibilized forms of structural violence"—it explains how power operates at the level of perception and self-understanding.

**How it's been applied to development:**

Recent research identifies [**"epistemic domination, through which Western-centric standards enact symbolic violence in Global South contexts, enforcing compliance while silencing alternative sustainability ontologies"**](https://www.emerald.com/aaaj/article/39/9/1/1323242/Layered-fields-of-power-a-Bourdieusian-critique-of).

For instance, when development agencies evaluate projects using Western metrics (GDP growth, formal employment, property rights), they're not just measuring—they're imposing a framework that makes certain achievements count (formal sector jobs) while rendering others invisible (subsistence agriculture, communal land management, social cohesion). Communities internalize these metrics and begin to see their own practices as "backward" or "inefficient."

**Symbolic violence operates through habitus at a subconscious level**, influencing how individuals perceive the world and their place within it. You don't consciously decide to accept the dominant framework—it becomes your common sense.

#### Applied to Próspera

**The symbolic violence dimensions:**

1. **Epistemic Imposition**: The "regulatory menu" from 36 OECD countries treats Western/Northern legal frameworks as the legitimate options. Where's the option to choose Indigenous governance models? Cuban healthcare frameworks? Bolivian plurinational constitutionalism? The "choice" itself is structured by power.

2. **Habitus Mismatch**: Próspera's governance assumes certain kinds of subjects:
   - Legible to bureaucracy
   - Comfortable with formal institutions
   - Able to navigate regulatory menus
   - Having the capital/skills to benefit from "innovation zones"

   This creates what Bourdieu would call **"habitus conflicts"**—[local communities whose "habits, skills, and dispositions" don't match the institutional environment imposed on them](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1474904116673644).

3. **Naturalization of Hierarchy**: Symbolic violence works when the dominated accept domination as legitimate. Notice how:
   - "Good governance" = OECD-style governance (not other kinds)
   - "Innovation" = tech/crypto/biotech (not agricultural, social, political innovation)
   - "Success" = business formation, investment (not community cohesion, ecological health, cultural preservation)

   The metrics themselves enact symbolic violence by making certain achievements count and others not.

4. **The Virginia Mann / Luisa Connor Split**: Virginia Mann (the satisfied employee) has successfully navigated the new habitus—she can function in Próspera's institutional environment. Luisa Connor (the frightened community leader) experiences habitus conflict—the new rules don't match her community's practices, knowledge, or power.

**Bourdieu's addition to our analysis**: It's not just that different frames see differently. The frames themselves are **weapons**. The freedom/governance frame, backed by $150M and treaty law, can impose itself materially. It doesn't just describe the world differently—it restructures the world to fit its description, and then claims vindication when people adapt to what it created.

### 6. What These Theories Reveal Together

Combining these frameworks shows something our initial frame analysis missed:

**Frame analysis showed**: Different frames generate different questions, organize facts differently, constitute different acts.

**Adding Ferguson**: The framing itself is a *political technology* that depoliticizes.

**Adding Ong**: Próspera is part of a global pattern of neoliberal exception-making, testing how far private sovereignty can go.

**Adding Bourdieu**: The frames aren't just cognitive—they're backed by material power that can impose themselves and naturalize hierarchies.

**Adding Luhmann**: The observation systems are self-reproducing; they're not just biased, they're **autopoietic**—they can't see outside themselves.

**Adding Goffman**: The same physical actions are being "keyed" into different frames simultaneously, and the fight is over which framing is legitimate.

### The Strengthened Analysis

**What we can now say about Próspera that we couldn't before:**

1. **It's not just competing frames, it's competing with differential power to impose frames** (Bourdieu)

2. **The "governance" framing is an anti-politics machine, rendering political questions technical** (Ferguson)

3. **It's a test case for private sovereignty zones, part of a global pattern** (Ong)

4. **The observation systems are self-reproducing and can't be corrected with more information** (Luhmann)

5. **Multiple legitimate framings of the same actions are in conflict, and we need to ask which framing should govern** (Goffman)

6. **The whole architecture is designed to survive exactly this situation: democratic government trying to exit corrupt predecessor's arrangement**

This isn't just "how do frames work?"—it's **"how does power operate through framing, and what happens when frames can buy territory?"**

---

The most unsettling implication of understanding frames as question-generators:

**You cannot resolve ideological conflict by providing more facts.**

Both sides can know all the same facts. Brimen can know about Hernández, the judicial coup, the community opposition, the power asymmetry. He can acknowledge all of it. And still genuinely believe he's doing the right thing.

Because the frame:
1. Generates different questions
2. Makes different things count as evidence
3. Organizes facts into different patterns
4. Constitutes different acts

The facts don't speak for themselves. They're always organized by something. And what organizes them is the frame.

To change someone's position, you don't need to give them information they lack. You need to change their frame—which means changing:
- Their community
- Their identity
- Their sense of what they're good at
- What gives their work meaning

This is why it's so difficult. And why ideological conflicts persist even among intelligent, informed, well-intentioned people.

The frame isn't a mistake to be corrected. It's a way of being in the world.

## Epilogue: And Now...

This same place is hosting crypto debate championships and "Infinite Games" festivals for tech bros to play prediction markets and get experimental gene therapies while a fishing village next door worries about losing their land and water.

Both groups are looking at the same physical reality. Both see completely different things.

Neither is hallucinating.

They're seeing through different frames.

And the frames determine not just what they see, but what they're doing.
